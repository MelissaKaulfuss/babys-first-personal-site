		<h1>The road to where?</h1>
		<p>I was always going to be an artist. In school I avoided maths or anything related to computers. I cut classes to hang out with the arts faculty staff, just shooting the breeze</p>
		<p>Albert Tucker told me "I'd get on in life" when I bumped into him at the NGV, he put his arm around me as he gave me his blessing. I got my degree in Computer Mediated Art at University and eventually decided computers weren't so bad afterall - though my exposure was to Flash and Director. After spending the next few years working in a record store and travelling the world I did an apprencticeship and worked as a tattoo artist.</p>
		<p>An old art lecturer visited one day and told me I'd get bored, ofcourse I disagreed! In the end, she was right. I walked away after a few years, saying it was like retail, only with more blood and fainting.</P>
		<p>The truth is, I'm never really happy unless I feel utterly out of my depth. If I'm coasting, I'm bored - I need to be challenged in everything I do. I think I've finally found it. I'm pretty much freaking the hell out about code and the sheer vastness of the things I need to know. I'm drowning here and that feels good :)</p>
		<p>I'm a Project Manager at Icelab Melbourne. It's great to be a part of a workplace and community that's so happy to help and share knowledge! I hope one day, to be able to pass on this goodwill.</p>
