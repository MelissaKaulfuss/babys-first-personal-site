		<h1>All about me</h1>
		<p>I was always going to be an artist. I painted abstracts in Kindergarten and my concerned teacher spoke with my mother about me not being "like the other kids".</p>
		<p>Continuing on this tragectory in secondary school, I wagged Maths and hung out with my Art and Graphic Design teachers â€“ drawing and shooting the breeze. My destiny, I thought, was already mapped out. Albert Tucker even told me so. I bumped into him at the NGV when I was in Year 12, he put his arm around me and said "you'll get on in life." I went to art school, I eventually finished a degree in Computer mediated art. After a stint as a goth working in a record store I decided to ditch the computer for tattooing. I finished my apprencticeship and worked as a tattoo artist for a few years.</p>
		<p>My old art lecturer visited me one day and told me I'd get bored, I disagreed at the time and thought she was being ridiculous. In the end, she was right and knew me better than myself. I walked away from this career, saying it was like retail, only with more blood and fainting.</P>
			<p>The truth is, I'm never really happy unless I feel totally out of my depth. If I'm comfortable, I'm bored. I'm always looking for the next challenge. I think I've finally found something to keep me interested and passionate for the rest of my days!</p>
