		<h1>The long road to internet</h1>

		<div class="content">

			<p>This is my website. It's a thing I have put on the internet all by myself and that makes me happy (and believe me, this doesn't look like much but it's *some* achievement!) Over the coming months I'll use this as a platform to share things I've learnt and things I have struggled with.</p>
			<p>I work at Icelab, a studio that designs and makes beautiful web applications – I don't create anything yet, I'm a project manager. I started out in my role with little technical knowledge. Gradually, my interest was piqued and I found myself wanting to know more and more. I started with Rails Girls last year, then Rails Girls next, now, I'm not sure where I am headed and not even sure if I'm making progress.</p>
			<p>It's a tough road I'm travelling but I know my tale is not unique – I love to get together with other newbies. It's such a great community that's full of support, this is enough to spur me on.</p>
