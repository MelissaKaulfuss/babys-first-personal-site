	<h1>The long road to internet</h1>
	<p>So it goes like this, I saw my collegues making nice web applications and things. I thought, how hard can this be? I'd love to learn more about what they do and try it myself. Well, I started with Railsgirls, I then did Railsgirls Next in Sydney at Rubyconf 2014, I then cried a lot. And now, I'm just starting with this.</p>
	<p>This is my website. It is a thing I have put on the internet. That makes me happy!</p>
	<p>Over the coming months, I'll use this as a platform to share things I've learnt, things I have struggled with, and just generally whinge to my audience of zero. THis sounds good to me :)</p>

	<h2>Why am I learning the art of web development?</h2>
	<p>I like internet and I like to learn. I'm happy when I'm out of my depth and I'm pretty much drowning so I figure this is good, right?</p>
